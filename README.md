## Color palette

#88292f (Dark Red): This rich, deep red brings a sense of elegance, sophistication, and passion, serving as a bold base color.

#2e1e0f (Dark Brown): This warm, earthy brown provides a grounding, natural feel, complementing the red and giving a sense of depth and stability.

The chosen colors create a balance between warmth and sophistication, embodying a timeless, grounded identity that feels both welcoming and rich. This palette is ideal for a brand that aims to feel both luxurious and approachable. The dark red and brown base evokes strength and elegance, while the lighter peach and beige accents soften and enhance visibility, creating a harmonious, inviting look.
